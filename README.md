# Snowball Battle

Welcome to my Snowball Battle multiplayer game built using [hathora.dev](https://hathora.dev/?utm_source=webdevcody&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=2023).

You can try playing the deployed version of this application here:

## Deploying

If you're like to deploy your own version, you'd need to either fork this repo and create a new repo and copy the code into your own repo. This code was deployed using vercel and github actions

### Deploying Client to Vercel

In order to deploy the client to vercel, you'll need to setup the following environment variables inside vercel:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_HATHORA_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
```

Create a vercel project and point it to the ./client sub directory. Your client will automatically deploy on each commit to main.

### Deploying using Github Actions

In order to have your server automatically deploy when pushing to github actions, you'll need to make sure you setup your github action environment variables:

```
HATHORA_TOKEN=YOUR_SECRET_APP_TOKEN
```
